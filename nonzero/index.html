    <h2>Description of game constants and values</h2>
    <ul>
    <li><code>Population:</code> <p>The number of participants</p></li>
    <li><code>MaxBet%:</code>  <p>In each trade (or gamble) the amount being bet is equal to the <code>MaxBet</code>% of the poorer player. For example, if we choose "<code>20%</code>" as the max betting percentage, and the two players betting have wealth of $100 and $1 million dollars, respectively, then the "stakes" they are gambling for would be <code>$20</code> as this is <code>20%</code> of the <em>poorer</em> player's wealth.</p></li>
    <li><code>Rounds:</code> <p>How many rounds have been played? A round consists of every player participating in 1 bet.</p></li>
    <li><code>PlaySpeed:</code> <p>How fast is the simulation running.</p> </li>
    <li><code class="hilite">TradeValueFactor:</code> <p>This is a variant of the original yard-sale-model. In each trade, in addition to one player being the "winner", I have both players gain a small amount, which represents the value created for them, by the trade. For example if the <code>TradeValueFactor</code> is <code>1%</code>, then instead of winning <code>$20</code> the winner would win an <em>extra</em> <code>1% * $20 = $0.2</code>, and receive <code>$20.20</code>, while the loser receives <code>20c</code>. This is a <strong>wildly</strong> unrealistic: in most consumer-level purchases at least one participant makes zero profit. The effects seem to be 1) runaway inflation if the factor is too high, and 2) it only takes longer to reach "perfect" inequality.</p></li>
    <li><code>GiniCoefficient:</code> <p>A measure of the inequality of a population. 0 means perfect equality (everyone has the same wealth), 1 means perfect oligarchy (every has no money, except one person who has all the wealth)</p></li>
    <li><code>TotalWealth:</code> Sum of each player's money. Initially the same as <code>populationSize * moneyPerPlayer</code>. If trades are zero sum, then this stays constant. If the <code>TradeValueFactor</code> is greater than zero, the 'pool' of wealth grows.</li>
    </ul>
