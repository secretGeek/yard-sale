      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>Population:</code>
          <p>The number of participants</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>MaxBet%:</code>
          <p>
            In each trade (or gamble) the amount being bet is equal to the
            <code>MaxBet</code>% of the poorer player. For example, if we choose
            "<code>20%</code>" as the max betting percentage, and the two
            players betting have wealth of $100 and $1 million dollars,
            respectively, then the "stakes" they are gambling for would be
            <code>$20</code> as this is <code>20%</code> of the
            <em>poorer</em> player's wealth.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>Rounds:</code>
          <p>
            How many rounds have been played? A round consists of every player
            participating in 1 bet.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>PlaySpeed:</code>
          <p>How fast is the simulation running.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code class="hilite">TradeValueFactor:</code>
          <p>
            This is a variant of the original yard-sale-model. In each trade, in
            addition to one player being the "winner", I have both players gain
            a small amount, which represents the value created for them, by the
            trade. For example if the <code>TradeValueFactor</code> is
            <code>1%</code>, then instead of winning <code>$20</code> the winner
            would win an <em>extra</em> <code>1% * $20 = $0.2</code>, and
            receive <code>$20.20</code>, while the loser receives
            <code>20c</code>. This is a <strong>wildly</strong> unrealistic: in
            most consumer-level purchases at least one participant makes zero
            profit. The effects seem to be 1) runaway inflation if the factor is
            too high, and 2) it only takes longer to reach "perfect" inequality.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>GiniCoefficient:</code>
          <p>
            A measure of the inequality of a population. 0 means perfect
            equality (everyone has the same wealth), 1 means perfect oligarchy
            (everyone has no money, except one person who has all the wealth)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>TotalWealth:</code> Sum of each player's money. Initially the
          same as <code>populationSize * moneyPerPlayer</code>. If trades are
          zero sum, then this stays constant. If the
          <code>TradeValueFactor</code> is greater than zero, the 'pool' of
          wealth grows.
